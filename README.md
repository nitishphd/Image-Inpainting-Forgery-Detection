# Image-Inpainting-Forgery-Detection
This is a supplementary material/ Image Inpainting Dataset/ Code for my article "Encoder-Decoder-based CNN Model for Detection of Object Removal by Image Inpainting"  
Inpainted Image Dataset consists of three folders: Inpainted Image, Cropped Image and Mask Imgae and each folder's details are below.
1. Inpainted Image: This folder contains the inpainted image created by exemplar-based image inpainting method by cropping an object from the image.
2. Cropped Image: This folder consists of images which shows the region or object which are removed from the image for inpainting.
3. Mask image: This folder contains the mask images showing the inpainted region as white and uninpainted region as black.
